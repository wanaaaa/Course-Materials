## Opening (5 mins)

One of the most commonly used libraries used in Java is the Collections class. We have already used Arrays and Lists. Today we will be covering in more detail the following popular collections: Lists and Maps. We will be learning about and comparing some of these today to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and how you should decide which to use. Once you have a better understanding of how to organize the information in your apps, you will be able to write much cleaner and more efficient code.

## Introduction:  Lists(10 mins)

First we will cover Lists, one of the most popular collection types. We know the basics of lists. They hold groupings of data, and provide a large set of helper functions that make manipulating the data much easier. You can search, sort, add and remove with ease. One of the major drawbacks of Lists are that they contain a larger overhead than a simple array (more memory, slightly slower due to all the work behind the scenes).

The two most commonly used types of lists are the ArrayList and the LinkedList. As the name implies, ArrayLists are backed by an array to hold the data. As we know, one major advantage over arrays is that you don't need to manually create larger arrays if your data set grows. Keep in mind that the ArrayList is taking care of this for you, so the operation isn't free. Therefore ArrayLists aren't the best choice for rapidly growing or shrinking sets of data.

A LinkedList is backed by a collection of objects linked together by pointers to each memory location. While we won't be going over how these are implemented, it is important to know that each element in the list is stored in empty spots in memory, so there is no need to worry about the changing size of the data set. Data is simply inserted and removed like links in a chain. Accessing a specific element in a linked list is generally slower than an array, because they aren't stored in sequential memory.

## Demo: Lists (5 mins)

We're going to begin with reviewing how to define a list.

``` java
List<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
```

The process for a LinkedList and ArrayList is the same, just with the class name changed.

```java
List<String> arrayList = new LinkedList<>();
```

That's it! Notice the type `String` between the brackets must match the type of data you want to store. Now you have an empty list ready to work with. To insert items, we do the following.

``` java
arrayList.add("Hello");
arrayList.add("Test");
```

There are many methods you can use to manipulate the list now. Let's take a look at a few.

``` java
arrayList.sort();
arrayList.contains("Test"); //Returns true because "Test" is in the list
arrayList.indexOf("Test"); //Returns 1, the index of "Test"
arrayList.get(1); //Returns "Test", because it's at index 1
arrayList.size() //Returns 3
```

As you can see, Lists make working with collections of data much more straightforward than arrays.

As a side note, you can actually convert between arrays and lists very easily.

``` java
String[] arr = {"one","two"};
List<String> stringArrayList = Arrays.asList(arr);
```

## Independent Practice: Lists (10 mins)

The students must create a LinkedList containing at least 10 Integers of their choice. Afterwards, they must test to see if even values exist in the list, and remove the elements that exist. Finally, print the size of the list.

## Introduction:  Maps(10 mins)

The next Collections type we will cover is the Map. A map is similar to a list, but each entry contains two parts: A key and a value. The key is unique in the map, think of it like the index in an array. Each key maps to a certain value, but there can be duplicate values in a map. Keys can be any kind of Object, but they are often Strings.

One of the most popular implementations of a map is called the HashMap. A HashMap is a map, as described above, where the data is stored in an array. The index where the data is stored is generated by something called a hash function. Basically, you give the HashMap the Object you want to use as a key, and it returns an integer to use as the index. When you try to retrieve the value from the map, it uses the same function to generate the same index. Strings are often used as the keys for a map.

### Collision (OPTIONAL 10 minutes)

The hash function isn't flawless, what happens if it gives us the same index for two keys? This is called a collision.


Java handles this by using a structure like a LinkedList in place of the actual Objects in the HashMap. If a collision occurs, the object is added onto the end of that list.

## Demo: Maps (10 mins)

Let's try implementing a HashMap. Pretend we have an inventory system for a store. Each item name has a quantity associated with it.

``` java
HashMap<String,Integer> inventoryMap = new HashMap<String,Integer>();

inventoryMap.put("paper towels",55);
inventoryMap.put("light bulbs",100);

Integer retrievedNum1 = inventoryMap.get("paper towels"); //55
Integer retrievedNum2 = inventoryMap.get("light bulbs"); //100

inventoryMap.remove("paper towels");

```
As you can see, a Map isn't that different from a List. You can add and retrieve objects. One major difference is that you have no direct control over the underlying data structure. There is no way for you to sort or control the order of the elements in the Map.

## Independent Practice: Maps (10 mins)

Let's create a HashMap that represents a dictionary. The key will be the word, and the value will be the definition. We must add the following value to the map, retrieve it, and print it to the console.

"apple":"A fruit from a tree"
"lake":"A large body of water"

## Independent Practice: Organizing Information (15 minutes)

The students will do the following:
  - Create an **array** of **ints** containing the values: 1,2,3,4
  - Create a **LinkedList** of **Strings** with the values: "One","Two","Three","Four"
  - Create a **HashMap**, using a loop, that uses the keys {"One","Two","Three","Four"} taken from the list, and the Integer values 1,2,3,4 taken from the array
  - Print out the HashMap size after adding the above items to it.

## Conclusion (5 mins)

We've covered the major components of the Collections class and how to use them. From sorting to searching, collections make organizing your data in the app very fast and easy. Arrays, lists and maps will become integral parts of your apps as you continue development, and working with them will become second nature. As you have seen in previous lessons, Android provides built-in tools to help integrate your list and array data directly into the Views on your apps.
