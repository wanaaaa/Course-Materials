## Exercise

Team up in groups of 2 or 3 and take turns working on the following problems. Pretend you are in an interview setting:
- Keep talking!
- Ask questions (to the instructors, or to your teammates)
- Consider starting with an example, showing the expected outputs for sample inputs
- Consider writing pseudocode before Java to make your steps clear to both you and the interviewer

Today we're going to focus on **recursion**, which is when a method calls itself. You need two things to avoid an infinite loop where the method keeps calling itself forever:

1. A _base case_, which returns a value without any further recursive calls (you can have more than one base case sometimes)
2. A _reduction step_, which changes the input before making the next recursive call, so as to make progress toward the base case

Consider this sample problem:

```java
// factorial(5), a.k.a. 5!, is defined as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
public static int factorial(int n) {
	if (n <= 1) {
		// this is the base case, when n is 1 (or less than 1)
		return 1;
	} else {
		// otherwise, reduce the input by 1 and make a recursive call
		return n * factorial(n - 1);
	}
}
```

#### Requirements

Take turns working through these problems on the whiteboard. It's OK if you don't finish them all; make as much progress as you can.

1. Write a recursive function called `reverse` that accepts a string and returns a reversed string. For example:
  - `reverse("abc")` -> "cba"
  - `reverse("ab")` -> "ba"
  - `reverse("a")` -> "a"
  - `reverse("")` -> ""

	One possible solution:

	```java
	public static String reverse(String str) {
		if (str.length() <= 1) {
			return str; // base case
     	} else {
			char lastLetter = str.charAt(str.length() - 1);
			// reduction step: reduce the size of the input for the next call
			String restOfString = str.substring(0, str.length() - 1);
			return lastLetter + reverse(restOfString);
		}
	}
	```

2. The fibonacci sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. where the sequence starts with two 1s, then each following entry is the sum of the previous two entries. Write a recursive function called `fib` that accepts a number `n`, greater than zero, and returns the Nth fibonacci number. For example:
  - `fib(1)` -> 1
  - `fib(2)` -> 1
  - `fib(3)` -> 2
  - `fib(4)` -> 3
  - `fib(5)` -> 5
  - `fib(-1)` and `fib(0)` -> 1 (input shoud be >= 1)

	One possible solution:

	```java
	public static int fib(int n) {
		if (n <= 0) {
			return 0; // base case A
		} else if (n <= 2) {
			return 1; // base case B
		} else {
			return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); // reduction step
		}
	}
	```

3. A _palindrome_ is a string that is spelled the same backwards and forwards. Put another way, a palindrome is a string where the first letter is equal to the last letter, and the second letter is equal to the second to last letter and so on and so forth. An empty string is considered a palindrome. A one letter string is considered a palindrome.

  Write a function called `isPalindrome` that accepts a string and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome, and returns `false` if the string is not. For example:
  - `isPalindrome("")` -> true
  - `isPalindrome("a")` -> true
  -	`isPalindrome("ab")` -> false
  - `isPalindrome("abba")` -> true
  - `isPalindrome("catdog")` -> false
  - `isPalindrome("tacocat")` -> true

	One possible solution:

	```java
	public static boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
		if (str.length() <= 1) {
			return true; // base case: empty and single-character strings
		} else {
			char first = str.charAt(0)
			char last = str.charAt(str.length() - 1);

			if (first != last) {
				return false; // cannot be a palindrome if these don't match
			} else {
				// reduction step: continue w/ middle of str excl. first and last chars
				String middle = str.substring(1, str.length() - 1);
				return isPalindrome(middle);
			}
		}
	}
	```

#### Deliverable

No deliverable - just practice working through problems out loud on a whiteboard
